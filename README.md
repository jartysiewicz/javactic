# Javactic
Java port of [Scalactic](http://www.scalactic.org/) (2.2.4) based on [Javaslang](http://javaslang.com/)(2.0.0). Mostly focused on [Or and Every](http://www.scalactic.org/user_guide/OrAndEvery), constructs *"inspired in part by the disjoint union (\/) and Validation types of [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz), the ProcessResult type of [Typesafe Activator](https://github.com/typesafehub/activator/), and the Result type of [ScalaKittens](https://github.com/vpatryshev/ScalaKittens)"*.

The Or(Good/Bad), Validation(Pass/Fail) and Accumulation stuff is implemented. Some methods in Every need stuff to be implemented in Javaslang collections to be ready.
